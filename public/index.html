<pre><code class="language-git">$ pip install html_table_parser
</code></pre>

<h2 id="synopsis:2e8e527b21ef2deedced2078cd8e4e6a">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Transform html tables into usable data structures.  Using beautiful soup table object, return 2D array structure, dictionary, or array of column data.  Imputes cell values from row and col spans :)</p>

<h2 id="code-example:2e8e527b21ef2deedced2078cd8e4e6a">Code Example</h2>

<p>Given an html table (with or without row and col spans). You can make a 2D array</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
from html_table_parser import parser_functions as parse

soup = bs(YOUR_HTML_TABLE, &quot;html.parser&quot;)
test_table = soup.find('table')
twod_array = parse.make2d(test_table)

# print 2D array
print(twod_array)
</code></pre>

<p>Use that 2D array to return column data by heading name</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># print column data by col heading name (case insensitive)
print(parse.twod_col_data(twod_array, 'YOUR_COL_HEADING'))
</code></pre>

<p>Or transform the soup table object (test_table) into a dictionary</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># row data begins on first row after col headings
# so rowstart is 1
print(parse.make_dict(test_table, 1))
</code></pre>

<h2 id="motivation:2e8e527b21ef2deedced2078cd8e4e6a">Motivation</h2>

<p>I looked everywhere for the code to transform html tables with row and col spans into a 2D array and couldn&rsquo;t find it.  So I thought how hard could it be to quickly write my own.  It was actally kinda hard, so here it is for the next guy.</p>

<h2 id="installation:2e8e527b21ef2deedced2078cd8e4e6a">Installation</h2>

<p>Works on Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.</p>

    <p>Wow, did not expect so much from a super successful serial investor, but boy was I wrong.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiel</a> kills it in his latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">book</a>.</p>

<p>What does he &ldquo;kill&rdquo; exactly?  Pessimism.  Well at least the most popular excuses for it.</p>

<p>That alone is a good reason to read this.  It&rsquo;s not a self help or make your startup rich book.  Rather it&rsquo;s an intellectual frame for the future and how to take part in it.</p>

<p>It challenges popular viewpoints in economics and technology.  Even I was hurt and offended at parts.  But Thiel makes a strong case and I won&rsquo;t discount his message just because I don&rsquo;t see eye to eye on every line.</p>

    <p>The Cityholla project was a finalist for the city of Santa Monica <a href="http://hackthebeach.com/contest/">&ldquo;Hack the Beach&rdquo;</a> contest 2015.  The code repo is private, but you can see our splash page <a href="https://desolate-lake-19599.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>They say that Moore&rsquo;s law only applies to hardware, but I agree with <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/">Ray Kurzweil</a> that software is also advancing at a more than linear rate.</p>

<p>I got a text on Sunday to create a landing page to display details and collect emails.  I had the site up and running on heroku that very night.  (Thanks <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.)</p>

<p>Just a couple years ago, this same splash page would have taken a team of front end engineers a full 2 week sprint.  The landing page code is public.</p>

    <p><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/">Pedro Domingos</a> gives a valient effort to bring the complexity and potential of machine learning (ML) to the average jane.

<p>I recommend this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning/dp/0465065708">book</a> to everyone who has an, at least, a peripheral understanding of data science.  Domingos does more than just skim the major algorithms.  He weaves their stories together in a coherent journey toward the ultimate algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:907c88537397ec981ae3b6c17395c58b">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Uses Wikipedia API to store page id, title, html, wiki text, expanded templates, categories, page links, and summary in one class object for easy reference.  Also parses infobox data from wiki text, including page name, template name, image name, image url, and labeled key value data.</p>

<h2 id="code-example:907c88537397ec981ae3b6c17395c58b">Code Example</h2>

<p>Instantiate Wikipedia API object with page name or id:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from wikipedia_parser.wikipedia_api import WikipediaAPI
# wikipedia search id can be digit or name (redirects are handled :)
search_id = 'Ada_Lovelace'
wiki_api = WikipediaAPI(search_id)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the print list of available api resources</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&gt; print(dir(wiki_api))
[   ...
    'categories',
    'expanded_html',
    'html',
    'page_id',
    'page_links',
    'search_id',
    'summary',
    'title',
    'wiki_text']
</code></pre>

<p>If an infobox is present on page, you can parse the infobox data:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from wikipedia_parser.infobox import Infobox
# wiki text can be from anywhere, does not need to come from WikipediaAPI object
wiki_text = wiki_api.wiki_text
infobox = Infobox(wiki_text)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the print list of available attributes</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&gt; print(dir(infobox))
[   ...
    'data',
    'image_filename',
    'image_url',
    'page_name',
    'template_name']
</code></pre>

<p>Infobox &ldquo;data&rdquo; is a dict with keys and values from wikipedia page&rsquo;s infobox (if page has infobox).
<br>Each key field in data returns a dict with values for &lsquo;plain_text&rsquo;, &lsquo;raw_text&rsquo;, and &lsquo;wiki_links&rsquo;.
<br>Compare with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank">Ada_Lovelace</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># infobox.data for &quot;Ada_Lovelace&quot; returns:

    <p>As developers, we wander through a thick forest of technology everyday.  Lost and unsure, we wish to find the wise ones who have come before.  Surly Douglas Crockford (Javascript), Simon Peython Jones (Haskell), or the great Knuth (Art of Programming) could show us the way.  If only we had their cell number.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-seibel-39518a72">Peter Seibel</a> has been to the top of the mountain.  In his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483">book</a> he interviews 15 of the greats on their history, their code practices and beliefs.  In effect, he attempts to answer: what is it that great programmers have in common?</p>

<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it if I told you, so my recommendation is to read it, and see the truth for yourself.</p>

<p><br>
We were trying to solve a big problem in a big way.  Become the premiere information source for US government licenses on the federal, state, and city level.  Our secret sauce was an ingest flow that allowed our research team of 10+ to learn, tag, and define requirements for all major licenses in the country.  With the biggest catalog in the world, our next feat was the client app.</p>

<p>Our entire office had read The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, so we were big into the MVP paradigm.  We ran experiments every sprint, measured results, redesigned, and A/B tested to confirm a sprint or two later.  Our NPS ranged from 50 to 70.</p>

<p>Using combination of pivotal, dropbox, and google sheets, our two week sprints began to rock.  Having a rockstar project manager and designer allowed our engineering team to open, execute, and set sail to a project every 2 or 4 weeks.  Epics were delivered according to which new feature would provide the most experimental data.</p>

<p>With 4 senior engineers including myself, we could all transition from the frontend to the backend.  There were no walls between tasks and we could easily trade work loads if it helped the sprint timeline.  This project was proof to me that Agile Scrum can work the way it promises.</p>

<p>The trick is to apply a fun and consistent sprint routine that encourages ownership.  We did it by working hand in hand with design and volunteering for agreed upon sprint goals.  Our user stories and designs were ready day one of the sprint.  Each day we wrote our task progress on a white board everyone could see.  Finished tasks were confirmed daily by management or designer and reflected in Pivotal Tracker.</p>

<p>When you know what&rsquo;s done every day, you can see what&rsquo;s left to do.  And when you&rsquo;re rooting for eachother and there are no wall between frontend and backend, you can help eachother win every sprint.</p>

    <p>The first third of the <a href="https://www.workrules.net/">book</a> is an unforgivable worship to Google. I almost wrote the book off as a mere marketing scheme. However, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock">Laszlo Bock</a> himself explains, Google has run a variety of experiments and collected data on things about the work place that no woman ever has before.</p>

<p>Bock clearly lays out the results of the experiments smaller companies couldn’t afford to do themselves, but can’t afford to ignore. He brings HR into the limelight and makes you want to quit your job to join the department of &ldquo;people operations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although he made referenced his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454836598&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=5+disfunction%27s+of+a+team">book</a> as a fable, his presentation also seemed to have just given away all of the valuable facts.  What in the world was the point of reading his work of fiction now?</p>

<p>We learn more by story than fact, and Lencioni&rsquo;s fable is yet another credit to that truth.  With preconceived notions that this book would not be worth the time, I picked it up off my manager&rsquo;s desk just to glance.  I didn&rsquo;t put it back down until it was finished.</p>

<p>Through his clever tale, the lessons come to life.  Even if you are on a fantastic team (as I was) you will find that learning about the dysfunctions you will invariably encounter, to be a pleasure.</p>

    <p>This is hands down the most technically challenging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Logician-Engineer-Shannon-Information/dp/0691151008">book</a> I&rsquo;ve ever read.  After reading The Information by James Gleick, I became enamored with Claude Shannon, discoverer of the bit, and father of the information age.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Nahin">Paul J. Nahin</a> makes the strong case that the lion&rsquo;s share of credit originates with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>.</p>

<p>Nahin accomplishes this by enumerating the boundless applications of boolean algebra.  He unapologetically tours the reader through complex riddles that would have daunted Einstein, but come apart like magic for the electrical engineer.</p>

<p>I actually don&rsquo;t recommend this book.  It&rsquo;s a pain, boring, and impractical.  Still Nahin&rsquo;s passion for boolean algebra is touching, even facinating.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/">Jaron Lanier</a> represents the opposite side of the spectrum from Ray Kurzweil, and in some ways, just as extreme.  Known as the man who coined the phrase &ldquo;virtual reality,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s played a sorted part in the history of computer science and is currently at Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>In the information age, is it any wonder that the companies that gather the most data on indiviuals in society are the richest?  And if we live in such an age, why are we giving our information away for free to these mega servers (Google, Amazon, Facebook)?</p>

<p>Lanier&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654979">book</a> is an almalgamation of his perspective on technology, econmics and the future.  Instead of fearing the AI singularity, which he feels is laughable, Lanier believes that society must take ownership of their online data, before the &ldquo;siren servers&rdquo; destroy our economy.</p>

<p>Lanier&rsquo;s claim&rsquo;s that these economic concerns and solutions are not predictions, but eventuallities.  His hope is that we learn our economic lessons sooner, rather than after a century long recession.</p>

<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s tough to make the call.  Lanier or Kurzweil.  Kurzeil or Lanier.  Both have been around so long and seen so much.  Both are renegades headed in opposite directions.  I think they go great together.</p>

    <p>How do you compete for fame with Larry Page and Sergey Brin?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenberg_(technologist">Jonathan Rosenber</a>), with the help of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alaneagle">Alan Eagle</a>, take a stab at in their book on how Google works, titled: How Google Works.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344">book</a> succeeds as an insider perspective about Google.  But as a professional engineer you can&rsquo;t help but wonder what parts are legit, and what is just self congratulating wishful thinking.</p>

<p>The employment strategy of hiring the best is a big theme.  The authors introduce their revolutionary notion of a &ldquo;smart creative.&rdquo;  One, she is a brilliant worker who doesn&rsquo;t have to have a PHd, but could easily get one if she wanted to.  Two, she is passionate about her crafts, of which she has many.  To paraphrase a couple of criteria.</p>

<p>The authors paint a pretty picture of the smart startup that broke all the rules to redefine the game.  And in the face of Google&rsquo;s success, who&rsquo;s to say they are wrong.  Skepticism aside, it&rsquo;s a great industry perspective done by a great team.</p>

    <p>So you want to know the whole life story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>?  Are you sure?  Well then you&rsquo;ll love <a href="http://www.synth.co.uk/">Andrew Hodges&rsquo;</a> biographical <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alan-Turing-Enigma-Andrew-Hodges/dp/1491587997">marathon</a>. (And yes it was the basis for the movie.)</p>

<p>This book divulges every intimate detail of Alan Turing&rsquo;s life and death.  Of which, computer science was just one part.  His paper on The Imitation Game, in which he outlines the de facto standard for artificial intelligence, is the least of his accomplishments.</p>

<p>Hodges leaves no stone unturned.  While the movie falsely portrays Turing as a socially inept genius stereotype, the true dreamer is charming.  Love, war, prejudice, loss.  Ahead of his time in so many ways, this biography celebrates the achievement of much more than the father of a science.  But that of an incredible human spirit.</p>

    <p>This may be the most important <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235">book</a> ever written.  <a href="http://around.com/">James Gleick</a> skillfully tells the story of, well, everything.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt like there is something bigger out there.  Bigger than you.  Bigger than society.  Behind the phenomenal universe there is something at work.  And it&rsquo;s growing.</p>

<p>Species come and go, but The Information is forever.  So what does this mean to the mere mortal human of today?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often heard that you have to know your history to know your future.  I thought that was just something that history professor&rsquo;s said to defend their diminishing usefulness in the economy.  But Gleick artfully illustrates how our world is most influenced by a background song that never ends.</p>

<p>Following the tune from indigenous Africa, through Ada Lovelace, and Richard Dawkins, Gleick clues us into what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-biography">Ray Kurzweil</a> does it again, and even better this time.  Unlike The Singularity Is Near, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/1491518839">book</a> pulls no punches for the technically timmid.</p>

<p>Kurzweil explains his controversial confidence that the way to AI is by reconstructing the human brain as a digital algorithm.  In fact, he asserts that for as complicated as the brain is, there may be only one algorithm at work.  And WHEN we do find it, there is no technical reason for why it can’t be duplicated.</p>

<p>Not betting the whole farm on any particular algorithm, he highlights the promise of Hidden Markov Models and potentials of modern neural networks.  (I don&rsquo;t think the term deep learning was as en vogue at the time of writing.)</p>

<p>Rather than committing to a solution, Kurzweil admirably postulates that there must be a solution, and it is inevitable that we will find it soon.</p>

<p>This book is what took me to the next level and got me into machine learning.</p>

    <p>Circa 2014, I worked at <a href="http://www.foxmovies.com/">Fox</a> as a member of the &ldquo;Dev Dream Team.&rdquo;  Everything they say about the movie business is true (even for the engineers).  Still we got to make a bunch of cool screener apps really quickly.</p>

<p>Our team made the screener app for the Oscar&rsquo;s the same year we won for 12 Years A Slave.  I just want to thank The Academy&hellip; and Jesus.</p>

    <p>For almost 3 years, I worked on a top secret project for <a href="http://www.disneystore.com/magicband/mn/1024701/">Disney</a>.  They launched in late 2013.  Of all my projects, I look back upon this one with the fondness of seeing something through from begining to end.</p>

<p>Working as a consultant for Accenture, my team ran the key service upon which all others depended.  It was great to see a project go from napkin drawings to RFID chips, molds, around the world, into customer homes, and onto happy children&rsquo;s wrists.  I still have mine from the first production ready batch.</p>

<p>With tens of engineers, hundreds of service endpoints, and millions of customers, you learn a lot about what it takes to make magic.  Coordination was currency and as our dev team&rsquo;s service and infrastructure liason I had my arms full.</p>

<p>My short experience in DevOps with Clearwire afforded our service team the credit to lead the heard of 50 or service teams.  Having a previous contract with Atlassian, I forged ahead with a Bamboo build and deployment process using Nexus.  We later moved to UDeploy which put much more power into QA and analysts hands.</p>

<p>And of course, we had a third party ESB and a third party cron manager.  Interacting with B2B software was beginning to take up my whole day.  Working with Java Hibernate was no picnic either, especially when our database schema was changing weekly.  Yet through challenge comes triumph, and I am ever thankful to the stakeholders of the **** project.</p>

    <p>Circa 2010, like most Microsoft employees, I was a contractor.  Through <a href="https://www.catalysis.com/">Catalysis</a> I worked on a some high profile projects including the Windows 7 registration page, Office 2010 registration page, and MSN.com tour.  Each of these projects were small in terms of content, but had high taffic functionality.</p>

<p>

<p>The registration pages required update and insert write access.  To avoid security concerns of SQL injection (cross browser security was big then), we opted for stored procedures.  This allowed us to go heavy on database hardware while maintaining a small frontend with a secure data access layer.  If I could go back in time, I would have implemented a queue and reserved backend resources when traffic was not high.</p>

<p>The frontend challenge was to localize Windows 7 and Office 2010 pages into over 70 languages.  Having a flexible UI to accommodate differing paragraph and input text lengths required lots of manual testing.  Making the localization performant took some time.</p>

<p>The MSN.com tour was a project to promote an MSN.com redesign.  Microsoft Window&rsquo;s butterfly was a key part.</p>

<p>We contracted the hard stuff to be done in both Flash and Silverlight.  This way the functionality happened on the client.  I created a wrapper website and we deployed the Flash and Silverlight files to Rackspace.  Back then we used to talk about HTML 5 the way we talk about web assembly today.

<p>Hired to the Technology Leadership Program straight out of college, my first job was to work on the controls team.  We were using the latest in Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 technology.  Remember .ascx “user controls.”  I think they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;components&rdquo; now.</p>

<p>I swear, can’t a button just be called a button.  How long are we as a tech community going to keep re-inventing the same thing.  I know, I know, it&rsquo;s the browser&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>Still looking at this screenshot I see a lot to learn from.  Good contrast, accessibilty, flat (mostly).  We had the best practice of bread crumbs and user tabs, for the time at least.</p>
