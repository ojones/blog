			      <p>Circa 2016, I worked at <a href="https://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a> as a member of the QuickBooks Licenses team.  Hard to say, harder to spell, and it doesn&rsquo;t even mean what you think it does:</p>

<p><br>
We were trying to solve a big problem in a big way.  Become the premiere information source for US government licenses on the federal, state, and city level.  Our secret sauce was an ingest flow that allowed our research team of 10+ to learn, tag, and define requirements for all major licenses in the country.  With the biggest catalog in the world, our next feat was the client app.</p>

<p>Our entire office had read The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, so we were big into the MVP paradigm.  We ran experiments every sprint, measured results, redesigned, and A/B tested to confirm a sprint or two later.  Our NPS ranged from 50 to 70.</p>

<p>Using combination of pivotal, dropbox, and google sheets, our two week sprints began to rock.  Having a rockstar project manager and designer allowed our engineering team to open, execute, and set sail to a project every 2 or 4 weeks.  Epics were delivered according to which new feature would provide the most experimental data.</p>

<p>With 4 senior engineers including myself, we could all transition from the frontend to the backend.  There were no walls between tasks and we could easily trade work loads if it helped the sprint timeline.  This project was proof to me that Agile Scrum can work the way it promises.</p>

<p>The trick is to apply a fun and consistent sprint routine that encourages ownership.  We did it by working hand in hand with design and volunteering for agreed upon sprint goals.  Our user stories and designs were ready day one of the sprint.  Each day we wrote our task progress on a white board everyone could see.  Finished tasks were confirmed daily by management or designer and reflected in Pivotal Tracker.</p>

<p>When you know what&rsquo;s done every day, you can see what&rsquo;s left to do.  And when you&rsquo;re rooting for eachother and there are no wall between frontend and backend, you can help eachother win every sprint.</p>
