This may be the most important [book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235) ever written.  [James Gleick](http://around.com/) skillfully tells the story of, well, everything.

Have you ever felt like there is something bigger out there.  Bigger than you.  Bigger than society.  Behind the random entropy of happenstance,  there is something at work.  And it's growing.

Species come and go, but The Information is forever.  So what does this mean to the mortal human of today?

I've often heard that you have to know your history to know your future.  I thought that was just something that history professor's said to defend their diminishing economic utility.  But Gleick artfully illustrates how our world is most influenced by a background song that never ends.

Following the tune from indigenous Africa, passed Ada Lovelace, and through Richard Dawkins, Gleick clues us into what's really going on.
