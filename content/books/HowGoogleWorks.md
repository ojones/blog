How do you compete for fame with Larry Page and Sergey Brin?  [Eric Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt) and [Jonathan Rosenber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenberg_(technologist)), with the help of [Alan Eagle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alaneagle), take a stab at in their book on how Google works, titled: How Google Works.

This [book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344) succeeds as an insider perspective about Google.  But as a professional engineer you can't help but wonder what parts are legit, and what is just self congratulating wishful thinking.

The employment strategy of hiring the best is a big theme.  The authors introduce their revolutionary notion of a "smart creative."  One, she is a brilliant worker who doesn't have to have a PHd, but could easily get one if she wanted to.  Two, she is passionate about her crafts, of which she has many.  To paraphrase a couple of criteria.

The authors paint a pretty picture of the smart startup that broke all the rules to redefine the game.  And in the face of Google's success, who's to say they are wrong.  Skepticism aside, it's a great industry perspective done by a great team.
