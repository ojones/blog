[Jaron Lanier](http://www.jaronlanier.com/) represents the opposite side of the spectrum from Ray Kurzweil, and in some ways, just as extreme.  Known as the man who coined the phrase "virtual reality," he's played a sorted part in the history of computer science and is currently at Microsoft Research.

Lanier's [book](http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654979) is an almalgamation of his perspective on technology, econmics and the future.  Instead of fearing the AI singularity, which he feels is laughable, Lanier believes that society must take ownership of their online data, before the "siren servers" destroy our economy.

In the information age, is it any wonder that the companies that gather the most data on individuals are the richest (Google, Amazon, Facebook)?  And if we live in such an age, why are we giving our information away to these siren servers for free?

Lanier's claims that these economic concerns and solutions are not predictions, but eventualities.  His hope is that we learn our economic lessons sooner, rather than after a century long recession.
