While attending a conference, I got the chance to see [Patrick Lencioni](http://www.tablegroup.com/pat/) speak about teams and their common dysfunctions.  I was impressed in the true sense of the word, and am confident he was the crowd favorite.

Although he made referenced his [book](http://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454836598&sr=1-1&keywords=5+disfunction%27s+of+a+team) as a fable, his presentation also seemed to have just given away all of the valuable facts.  What in the world was the point of reading his work of fiction now?

We learn more by story than fact, and Lencioni's fable is yet another credit to that truth.  With preconceived notions that this book would not be worth the time, I picked it up off my manager's desk just to glance.  I didn't put it back down until it was finished.  

Through his clever tale, the lessons come to life.  Even if you are on a fantastic team (as I was) you will find that learning about the dysfunctions you will invariably encounter, to be a pleasure.
