While attending an Intuit conference, I got the chance to see [Patrick Lencioni](http://www.tablegroup.com/pat/) speak about teams and their common dysfunctions.  I was impressed in the true sense of the word, and I'm confident he was the crowd favorite.

Although he had referenced his [book](http://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454836598&sr=1-1&keywords=5+disfunction%27s+of+a+team) as a fable, he also seemed to have just presented all of the valuable details.  What in the world was the point of reading his work of fiction now?

We learn more by story than fact, and Lencioni's fable is yet another credit to that truth.  With a preconceived notion that the book would not be worth the time, I picked it up off my manager's desk just to glance.  I didn't put back down until it was finished.  

Through his clever tale, the lessons come to life.  Even if you are on a fantastic team, as I was, you will find that learning about the dysfunctions you will invariably encounter, to be a pleasure.
