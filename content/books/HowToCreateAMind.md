[Ray Kurzweil](http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-biography) does it again, and even better this time.  Unlike The Singularity Is Near, this [book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/1491518839) pulls no punches for the technically timmid.

Kurzweil explains his controversial confidence that the way to AI is by reconstructing the human brain as a digital algorithm.  In fact, he asserts that for as complicated as the brain is, there may be only one algorithm at work.  And WHEN we do find it, there is no technical reason for why it canâ€™t be duplicated.

Not betting the whole farm on any particular algorithm, he highlights the promise of Hidden Markov Models and potentials of modern neural networks.  (I don't think the term deep learning was as en vogue at the time of writing.)

Rather than committing to a solution, Kurzweil admirably postulates that there must be a solution, and it is inevitable that we will find it soon.

This book is what took me to the next level and got me into machine learning.
