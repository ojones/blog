So you want to know the whole life story of [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)?  Are you sure?  Well then you'll love [Andrew Hodges'](http://www.synth.co.uk/) biographical [marathon](http://www.amazon.com/Alan-Turing-Enigma-Andrew-Hodges/dp/1491587997). (And yes it was the basis for the movie.)

This book divulges every intimate detail of Alan Turing's life and death.  Of which, computer science was just one part.  His paper on The Imitation Game, in which he outlines the de facto standard for artificial intelligence, is the least of his accomplishments.  

Hodges leaves no stone unturned.  While the movie falsely portrays Turing as a socially inept genius stereotype, his true nature is much more charming.  Love, war, prejudice, loss.  Ahead of his time in so many ways, this biography celebrates the achievement of an incredible human spirit.
