This is hands down the most technically challenging [book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Logician-Engineer-Shannon-Information/dp/0691151008) I've ever read.  After reading The Information by James Gleik, I became enamored with Claude Shannon, discoverer of the bit, and father of the information age.  [Paul J. Nahin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Nahin) makes the strong case that the lion's share of credit originates with George Bool.

Nahin accomplishes by enumerating the boundless applications of boolean algebra.  He unapologetically tours the reader through complex riddles that would daunt Albert Einstein, but come apart like magic for the electrical engineer.

I actually don't recommend this book.  It's a pain, boring, and impractical.  Still Nahin's passion for boolean algebra is touching, even facinating.
