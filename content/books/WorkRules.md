The first third of the [book](https://www.workrules.net/) is an unforgivable worship to Google. I almost wrote the book off as a mere marketing scheme. However, as [Laszlo Bock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock) himself explains, Google has run a variety of experiments and collected data on things about the work place that no woman ever has before.

Bock clearly lays out the results of the experiments smaller companies couldn’t afford to do themselves, but can’t afford to ignore. He brings HR into the limelight and makes you want to quit your job to join the people operations.
