Wow, did not expect so much from a super successful serial investor, but boy was I wrong.  [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) kills it in his latest [book](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296).

What does he "kill" exactly?  Pessimism.  Well at least the most popular excuses for it.

That alone is a good reason to read this.  It's not a self help, or make your startup rich book.  Rather it's an intellectual frame of the world and how to take part in the future.

It challenges popular viewpoints in economics and technology.  Even I was hurt and offended at parts.  But Thiel makes a strong case and I won't mock him just because I don't eye to eye on every line.
