You would think that a tech [book](http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom-ebook/dp/B00LOOCGB2) with such a cool title on such an interesting subject coudn't possibly lose.  But you'll be snoring at the 40% mark.  It turns out that detailed hypotheticals about exactly how and when the world will be destroyed is not fun.  Who knew?

The one saving grace that makes the whole thing worth it is the movie "Ex Machina," which should be required after every reading.  It is doubtful that you will understand the plot of the movie without the background [Nick Bostrom](http://www.nickbostrom.com/) gives.  Dry as it may be, it's the only book I've found that tackles the dangers of AI seriously.
