As developers, we wander through a thick forest of technology everyday.  Lost and unsure, we wish to find the wise ones who have come before.  Surly Douglas Crockford (Javascript), Simon Peython Jones (Haskell), or the great Knuth (Art of Programming) could show us the way.  If only we had their cell number.

[Peter Seibel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-seibel-39518a72) has been to the top of the mountain.  In his [book](http://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483) he interviews 15 of the greats on their history, their code practices and beliefs.  In effect, he attempts to answer: what is it that great programmers have in common?

You wouldn't believe it if I told you, so my recommendation is to read it, and see the truth for yourself.
