The Cityholla project was a finalist for the city of Santa Monica <a href="http://hackthebeach.com/contest/" target="blank">Hack the Beach"</a> contest 2015.  The code repo is private, but you can see our splash page <a href="https://desolate-lake-19599.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>).

They say that Moore's law only applies to hardware, but I agree with Ray Kurzweil that software is also advancing at a more than linear rate.

I got a text on Sunday to create a landing page to display details and collect emails.  I had the site up and running on heroku that very night.  (Thanks <a href="http://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.)

Just a couple years ago, this same splash page would have taken a team of front end engineers a full 2 week sprint.  The landing page code is public.
```git
git clone https://github.com/ojones/cityhollalanding.git
```
