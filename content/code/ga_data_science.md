This was <a href="https://gentle-bayou-19852.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">my project</a> from General Assembly Data Science course taught by Nick Stucky from Whisper.

Say what you will about coding bootcamps, <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science" target="_blank">this</a> class was amazing.  Nick gave us a solid overview of the data science field in general.
