Not another Twitter sentiment analyzer...

This was my project from General Assembly Data Science course taught by Nick Stucky from [Whisper](https://whisper.sh/).

Say what you will about coding bootcamps, [this](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) class was amazing.  Nick gave us a solid overview of the data science field in general.
