## Synopsis

Nifty <a href="http://ojones.github.io/CordFlow/" target="_blank">proof of concept</a> that demonstrates how to convert paper to JSON.  Also demonstrates how the json object can be used to automatically generate a web form and apply the answers back to paper.
<br />
Though we never brought it out of the concept phase, this POC has inpired a HR production system in one of LA's most successful startups.

## Motivation

We made this for a contest as a proof of concept.  There are still so many government paper forms.  Even fillable pdfs don't easily let you apply webform data.  This project proves you can use javascript to convert paper into web objects with just an image of the paper form.


## Installation

Just clone and open the index.html file in your web browser.
