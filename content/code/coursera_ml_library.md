Project for Coursera Machine Learning class with Stanford Professor Andrew Ng.

Most everyone already knows but in case you don't, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">this</a> is the best intro to machine learning in the world.  <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/" target="_blank">Andrew Ng</a>, co-founder our Coursera, compassionately surveys the field of machine learning algorithms.  It is he who sparked my passion for data science and many thousands more.  And did I mention the class is free.
