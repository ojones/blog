Project for Coursera Machine Learning class with Stanford Professor Andrew Ng.

Most everyone already knows but in case you don't.  [This](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is the best intro to machine learning in the world.  [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/), co-founder our Coursera, compassionately surveys the field of machine learning algorithms.  It is he who sparked my passion for data science and many thousands more.  And did I mention the class is free.
