Circa 2007, we at [Wamu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mutual) (aka Washington Mutual) thought we were the coolest bank.  Cool nickname, cool kiosks.  So of course we had to have the coolest website. (Ahem, for a bank.)

Hired to the Technology Leadership Program straight out of college, my first job was to work on the controls team.  We were using the latest in Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 technology.  Remember .ascx “user controls.”  I think they're called "components" now.

I swear, can’t a button just be called a button.  How long are we as a tech community going to keep re-inventing the same thing.  I know, I know, it's the browser's fault.

Still looking at this screenshot I see a lot to learn from.  Good contrast, accessibilty, flat (mostly).  We had the best practice of bread crumbs and user tabs, for the time at least.
