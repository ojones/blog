Circa 2012, I worked on a top secret project for [Disney](http://www.disneystore.com/magicband/mn/1024701/). Code words, security... really can't say anymore.

Working as a consultant for Accenture, my team's service was the source of truth for the cradle to grave lifetime of each MagicBand.  It was great to see a project go from napkin drawings to RFID chips, molds, China, India, Seattle, Orlando, into customer homes, and onto children's wrists.  I still have mine from the first production ready batch.

With tens of services, hundreds of engineers, and millions of customers, you learn a lot about what it takes to make magic.
