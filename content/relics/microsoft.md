Circa 2009, like most Microsoft employees, I was a contractor.  Through [Catalysis](https://www.catalysis.com/) I worked on a number of high profile projects.

Remember these:

Well I worked on the msn.com tour, the Windows 7 registration page, and Office 2010 registration page.  

Flash, localization, Rackspace.  Those were good days (wait, were they).  I was still a new developer but my websites were getting six figure hits.
