Circa 2013, I worked at [Fox](http://www.foxmovies.com/) as a member of the "Dev Dream Team."  Everything they say about the movie business is true (even for the engineers).  Still we got to make a bunch of cool screener apps really quickly.

Our team made the screener app for the Oscar's the same year we won for 12 Years A Slave.  I just want to thank The Academy... and Jesus.

After making a few screener apps (web and mobile), we thought why not make a generic admin tool so anyone at Fox can share copyrighted video content.

This is the industry so we can't just put things on youtube.  We have a DRM process for everything.  That takes asset management, tracking, and Telerik.

But why stop there, let's make an asset monolith with teams from all over the world.  You give me the designs, I give you back Knockout templates.
