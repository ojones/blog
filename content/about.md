I am a software engineer at [Mediahound](https://www.mediahound.com/) where I work on The Entertainment Graph(TM) powered by Neo4j.  

I love coding in Python, Javascript, and C#, but am also interested in modern functional languages (Ruby is cool too).  This blog is powered by Hugo, which is coded in Go.
